üìò Portfolio ‚Äî Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio, a collection of projects I completed during my university studies in Data Science.
Each project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and exploration using Python (Pandas) and SQL, demonstrating my ability to extract insights from raw data and communicate findings effectively.



üéØ Objective

This portfolio is designed to showcase my technical and analytical skills in working with real-world-style datasets.
Although these projects were developed as part of my academic coursework, they follow industry best practices and highlight my proficiency in:

- Data wrangling and cleaning with Pandas

- Querying and managing data with SQL

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data visualization and storytelling

- Writing clean, reproducible, and well-documented code
